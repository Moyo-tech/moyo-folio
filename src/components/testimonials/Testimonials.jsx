Leveraging her advanced excel skills, she developed an attendance tracker almost overnight. Moyo has the ability to facilitate effectively, get a good command of the class and capture her audience's attention. She is an effective problem solver with a positive attitude and calm demeanour and works well in a fast-paced environment. I have no doubt that Moyo will exceed in whatever endeavour she pursues."
